# LinuxCommands
Some sample code from my project for CptS 360 (Systems Programming). The project required me to implement several Linux commands including cd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, read, and write. Originally written using Ubuntu, programmed in C using Gnu Emacs as the editor. Part of a collaboration with fellow classmate, Sarah Hughes.
